<main id = "content">
<p>Mario Kart is a series of go-kart racing video games that was a spin-off of the Super Mario series. Although Mario Kart gained popularity as a Wii game, it was initially released as Super Mario Kart for the Super Nintendo in 1992.</p>

<p> In the Mario Kart series, players compete in races as a Mario franchise character. Players obtain power-ups by driving into random item boxes on the course. Usually players in the lead receive defensive items, while players lagging behind receive powerful power-ups.</p>

<p> Mario Kart Wii incorporates the same characters from the Mario series, but develops them by giving them their own carts, bikes, and tracks. The Wii game uses the Wii remote's motion sensors to give the player the experience of steering the vehicle through obstacles in the race. While driving, the player can collect power-ups from item boxes. These power-ups allow the player to gain an advantage, such as speed, or attack other players on the track. </p>

<p>Even though the core concept of Mario Kart has stayed the same, the change in gaming system evolution of time has brought about a significant change in visualization and capability. For example, there is a wider selection of characters and race tracks. In addition, Mario Kart also has a coin battle feature in which players have to try to collect and retain as many coins as possible. Although Nintendo has changed up many aspects of Mario kart, the core experience still remains the same.</p>
